            My name is Anjay. I am a boy, 19, in college, on a road in life. <br>
            I am from Singapore, the city of clean streets & gumless benches. <br>
            I go to Vanderbilt, kids aren't as happy as said. <br>
            But that doesn't mean that life isn't good

            <br> <br> <br> 

            I believe in meditation & sleeping 7.5 hours.
            <br> 
            I don't meditate or sleep 7.5 hours regularly. 
            <br>
            Things are like that sometimes

            <br> <br> <br>
